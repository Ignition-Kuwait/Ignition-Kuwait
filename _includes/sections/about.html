      <p>
        <span class="ignition">Ignition</span> was founded by a group of young Kuwaitis from various
        disciplines: Civil, Architectural, Electrical, and Computer. What brought these four together is a shared desire
        to take Kuwait to space through research, development, and education. To realize this goal, the four founders
        launched Ignition. Ignition is Kuwait's first ever Space Exploration Research & Development company. The purpose
        of Ignition is to lay the groundwork for the first Kuwaiti space program which will play a key role in the
        Kuwaiti scientific research field. Ignitionâ€™s vision is to support the growth of society in terms of research,
        education, leadership, community engagement, and innovation.
