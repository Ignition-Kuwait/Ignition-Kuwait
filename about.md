Ignition Kuwait is a local chapter of the Mars society. We inspire locals in Kuwait to pursue space technology and space exploration projects, by organizing public outreach programs to foster a deep interest in Mars and space exploration, we also promote broad international support for government-funded Mars research and exploration, and advocate the establishment of commercial space ventures, that will help in achieving space exploration in Kuwait.
